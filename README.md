## 📋 Requirements

- [DevPod CLI](https://devpod.sh/docs/getting-started/install)

## 🛠️ Tool Installation

The development tools are automatically installed when the container starts via `.devcontainer/install-tools.sh`. However, this automatic installation may occasionally fail due to timing or permission issues during container initialization.

### Manual Installation

If any tools fail to install automatically, you can run the installation script manually:

```bash
bash .devcontainer/install-tools.sh
```

This will:

- Attempt to install all missing tools
- Generate a detailed report at `.devcontainer/installation-report.md`
- Provide manual installation instructions for any tools that fail

### Viewing Installation Status

To check which tools were successfully installed:

```bash
cat .devcontainer/installation-report.md
```

## 🔧 Manual VS Code Usage

If you prefer to use VS Code directly:

1. Clone this branch: `git clone -b workspace/basic https://github.com/mrkingsleyobi/agentic-quickstart`
2. Open in VS Code
3. Install the Dev Containers extension
4. Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
